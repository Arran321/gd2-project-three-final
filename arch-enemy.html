  <div class="ship1">The vowels are the most powerful five families in our world, I and A are more prominent because they can be a word themselves. The status of other three vowel family is also a lot higher than consonants because they are needed to combine with consonants. Many companies and factories, governments and schools are monopolized by these five families.
</div>
<div class="ship2">There are 21 consonant letters. They usually have no social status. They do all the work of foiling. Sometimes they are not pronounced in a word. They just show their faces, but sometimes when they have a good relationship with vowels, they could be respected. For example, “m” often appears with “I” and apostrophe, so the status of “m” has also improved. But I heard that in a parallel world, such as the world of Chinese, some letters such as v will not be used at all, so they will never be produced. It is quite horrible. The appearance of one “person” in another world is completely wiped out.</div>
