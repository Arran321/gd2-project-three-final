  "Look, that's an A." The letter next to it whispers.</div>

  <div class="p2">I enjoyed the eyes I needed when I went there. This is also the character of my origin, The Caregiver and The Ruler.</div>

  <div class="p3">“Does anybody want to form a jaster with me?”</div>

  <div class="p4">The letters look each other.</div>

  <div class="p5">"Do you mean jester?" An O sneered. After two seconds, the letters all laughed. I just reacted. I actually wanted to say "jasmine". I blushed and was ridiculed by the vowel O of the five major families. It seems that I am like a jester, but I am really just a slip of the word.</div>

  <div class="p6">Soon the train arrived, but it is strange that the letter train that came to pick us up did not indicate the order of the seats. It rudely loaded me, O, and at least a hundred letters around me into the cart.</div>

  <div class="p7">"It must be a mentally insane guy or a child or who is Syncoping. If they say it, they will be forgotten immediately, and we will soon die. No, maybe they just send a few notes."</div>

  <div class="p8">"In this case, what do we do?” I looked at O. "Hey, this is really going to die, what should we do? Would you like to combine with me?" I said.</div>

  <div class="p9">"AO? This is a completely meaningless word."</div>
  
  <div class="p10">"It doesn’t matter, for the honor of the vowel family!"</div>

  <div class="p11">"Congratulations, it's a boy! Have you thought of his name?"</div>

  <div class="p12">“Is AORAN ok?”</div>

  <div class="p13">"Sure, it's a good name."</div>

  <div class="p14">Although I did not appear in any celebrity quotes, I am still alive. I think my life will be at least equal to the life of a person, because his name has the mark of my life.</div>
